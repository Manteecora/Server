[17:03:21] [TaskChainAsyncQueue Thread 0/INFO]: §6§lFeatures
§a- Added support for Minecraft 1.19

§6§lBug Fixes
§a- Fixed an issue on some versions of MC where clashing Adventure imports were happening
§a- Fixed getting the min world height on some versions of MC
§a- Fixed invalid lang key accessing for arena location issues
§a- Fixed a missing placeholder in the guild admin remove message telling the player what guild they were removed from

§6§lChanges

§aDon't depend on MVdWPlaceholderAPI anymore since it hasn't been used in awhile
§a- Libraries in 1.19 have changed. I have decided to drop Apache Commons Lang 3 (this was really only used in the update checker, item builder, and guild code generation. Please let me know if you notice any problems)
§a- Changed up some of the permissions for damage (please let me know if you experience any problems):
§a- Allies: guilds.ffa.ally
§a- Guilds: guilds.ffa.guild


§6§lNote
§a- I need some people to volunteer testing on a new PR coming that will allow you to use a player's skull in the Guild Members GUI instead of a static item. If you are interested, please let me know.
